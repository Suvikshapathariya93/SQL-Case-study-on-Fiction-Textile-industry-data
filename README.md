## Case study: Questions and Answers

**1. Total Sales by Product**
- Objective: What are the total sales and quantities sold for each product?
```sql
SELECT P.ProductID, P.ProductName,
    SUM(S.Quantity) AS TotalQuantitySold,
    SUM(S.TotalAmount) AS TotalSales
FROM Products P
JOIN Sales S ON P.ProductID = S.ProductID
GROUP BY P.ProductID, P.ProductName
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;
```
- **Joins**: 
  - `Products` is joined with `Sales` using `ProductID`.
- **Aggregations**:
  - `SUM(S.Quantity)` calculates the **total quantity sold** for each product.
  - `SUM(S.TotalAmount)` calculates the **total sales revenue** for each product.
- **Grouping**: Results are grouped by `ProductID` and `ProductName`.
- **Ordering**: Data is sorted in descending order of `TotalSales` (highest sales first).

**2. Monthly Sales Trend**
- Objective: What is the monthly sales trend for the company?
```sql 
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(S.SaleDate, '%Y-%m') AS Month, SUM(S.TotalAmount) AS TotalSales
FROM Sales S
GROUP BY Month
ORDER BY Month;
```

**3. Top-Selling Categories**
- Objective: Which product categories generate the most revenue?
```sql
SELECT P.Category, SUM(S.TotalAmount) AS TotalSales
FROM Products P
JOIN Sales S ON P.ProductID = S.ProductID
GROUP BY P.Category
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;
```
